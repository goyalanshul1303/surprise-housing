# Surprise Housing
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The optimal Alpha value using Ridge regression is 500. and using LASSO is 0.02
- The R2 Score from Ridge and LASSO is more than 0.82.
- The LASSO having less alpha value and less complexity in term of predictor variables used is recommended as a model.
- There are around 30 variables having significant beta coefficients.
